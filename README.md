# myFlix Application

## Description

This application provides the front-end needed for using the movie-api. Together they allow a registered user to view information on movies and create a list of their own favorite movies.

## Purpose

The application was created to get familiar with Single Page Applications in general and React in particular. Furthermore it allowed me to learn about the Model-View-Controller and the Flux architectural patterns.

## Details

myFlix is written in React. It uses React Bootstrap for styling, React Redux for state management and Axios to communicate with the API.
